# PROGRESS.md

**Update this at the end of every session. A stale PROGRESS.md is actively harmful.**

## Current Status

*(2026-05-06 session 4)* **Repo cleanup + security hardening.** Deleted ML stubs. Removed backend port 8000 host-binding from prod compose (no longer publicly accessible — internal Docker network only). Deleted `create-test-user` and `debug-login` endpoints (both unauthenticated, exposed known credentials). Wired in `RateLimitMiddleware` at 120 req/min globally; added 10-attempt/min per-IP rate limit on `/api/auth/token` and `/api/auth/register`. Fixed `X-Forwarded-For` spoofability in rate limiter. **Still unverifiable from code**: whether Portainer port 9004 is firewalled at the router — if internet-accessible, that remains the highest-risk surface. Deleted `backend/src/utils/vector_db.py`, `backend/scripts/build_vector_db.py`, and `backend/scripts/rules_parser.py` (ML stubs not wired into anything). Removed stale comment about `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` from `docker-compose.prod.yaml`. Updated CLAUDE.md to remove references to deleted files. `_cleanup_backup/` was already gone. `frontend/src/lib/utils.ts` kept — still used by `src/components/ui/` shadcn components. CHANGELOG.md updated. All PROGRESS.md cleanup items resolved.

*(2026-05-06 session 3)* **Production stack fully operational. Deploy workflow automated — no more manual Portainer step.** Fixed `INTERNAL_API_URL` missing from Portainer stack (was `http://localhost:8000` fallback inside container). `deploy.sh` now authenticates with Portainer API and triggers stack redeploy automatically after push. `docker-compose.prod.yaml` is now the single source of truth (synced with Portainer). Deleted dead `frontend/src/lib/config.ts` (referenced `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` but was never imported — api.ts already uses relative URLs). `frontend/public/.gitkeep` added so Docker build doesn't fail on missing `public/` dir. Full smoke test passed: cards/aspects/types/sets/keywords all 200 on production at `192.168.1.124:4000`. Deploy workflow is now: `./deploy.sh` → done (no Portainer visit needed).

*(2026-05-06 session 2)* **Profile page design pass complete. ML deps split out. All TypeScript errors cleared.** Profile page fully on Twin Suns design system. `requirements-ml.txt` created. Fixed Docker `INTERNAL_API_URL` missing from dev compose (cards wouldn't load in Docker mode). Fixed `stats/route.ts` using wrong env var. Fixed `DeckBuilderClient` `power`/`hp` → `attack`/`health` — **frontend now compiles with zero TypeScript errors**. Production stack is down on TrueNAS (port 4000 connection refused, SSH 24 not responding) — needs manual restart via Portainer before `./deploy.sh` results are visible.

*(2026-05-06)* **Twin Suns Imperial Field Manual design system fully implemented. Wishlist feature live (full stack).** PR #3 merged into `development`. No regressions introduced; pre-existing TypeScript errors in `decks/[id]/route.ts` (Next.js params type) and `DeckBuilderClient.tsx` (`power`/`hp`) are unchanged. Backend `user_wishlist` table auto-creates on next startup via `create_all` — no migration script needed.

*(2026-05-05)* **Production stack rebuilt and operational after cryptominer incident.** Both `twinsuns-backend:local` and `twinsuns-frontend:local` images rebuilt from `--no-cache` using rsynced clean local source. Stack started via `docker-compose.prod.yaml`. Smoke test passed: cards/aspects/types return data, collection/decks return 401 (correct). Stack healthy at `192.168.1.124:4000`.

*(2026-05-05)* **Local dev smoke test complete.** Fixed `PORT=8000` bug in `.env.dev` that caused Next.js to start on port 8000 (conflicting with uvicorn). Local dev environment is stable: frontend on `:3000`, backend on `:8000`. Full end-to-end flow verified: login → deck builder renders → leaders load (2,360 total cards) → aspect filtering logic confirmed → deck CRUD works via API → cards page works with all filters. No console errors.

*(2026-05-04)* **Repo integration complete.** `twin-suns-databases` merged into this repo. All hardcoded `~/.swu` paths replaced with `DB_DIR`. TypeScript clean. **`twin-suns-databases` repo can now be archived.**

*(2026-05-04)* **Production stack is fully operational.** JWT secret rotated. All containers running on TrueNAS (`192.168.1.124:4000`). Smoke test passed: 1398 cards loading, aspects/types/keywords/sets all return data.

## What's Done

- [x] **[2026-05-06] DeckBuilderClient `power`/`hp` → `attack`/`health` — zero TypeScript errors**
  - Frontend now compiles clean with no errors at all
- [x] **[2026-05-06] Docker dev compose: add missing `INTERNAL_API_URL=http://backend:8000`**
  - Without this, Next.js route handlers fall back to `localhost:8000` inside the container (wrong); cards/aspects/etc. all fail
  - Also fixed `stats/route.ts` which used `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` server-side instead of `INTERNAL_API_URL`
- [x] **[2026-05-06] Profile page — full Twin Suns design system rewrite**
  - All shadcn components removed from `profile/page.tsx` (Avatar, Badge, Button, Card, Input, Switch, Tabs — Radix Tabs primitives kept for state, styled with `ts-tabs-list`/`ts-tab-trigger`)
  - `framer-motion` and all Lucide icon imports removed
  - `DeckCard`, `CollectionCard`, profile header, tab nav, all empty/loading/error states rewritten with `ts-*` CSS vars and design system patterns
  - `handleAddToCollection` bug fixed: was checking `.ok` on parsed JSON (always false), now uses try/catch on `fetchWithAuth`
- [x] **[2026-05-06] ML dependencies split to `requirements-ml.txt`**
  - `torch`, `sentence-transformers`, `qdrant-client`, `transformers`, `numpy` removed from `requirements.txt`
  - `backend/requirements-ml.txt` created — install separately when working on AI features
- [x] **[2026-05-06] `.env.dev` / `.env.prod` unstaged from git index**

- [x] **[2026-05-06] Twin Suns design system — Imperial Field Manual** (PR #3)
  - `globals.css` + `layout.tsx`: full `--ts-*` CSS custom property system; Cormorant Garamond (display), Spectral (body), JetBrains Mono (data/code) fonts
  - `page.tsx`: hero rewrite with absolute-positioned twin suns (radial gradient circles), scanlines overlay (`repeating-linear-gradient`), left vignette, correct copy, Deck of the Cycle spotlight, Pilot Training rank tracks
  - `Navbar.tsx`: full redesign with Twin Suns branding
  - `login/page.tsx` + `signup/page.tsx`: removed all shadcn/lucide; restyled with `ts-*` classes, Callsign/Security Code/Comm Channel labels, amber CTA buttons, red/green error/success panels
  - `DeckBuilderClient.tsx`: design system integration
  - `icon.svg`: twin suns favicon (amber + red circles); served automatically by Next.js App Router
  - `HandSimModal.tsx`: extracted as standalone component; mulligan mode adds editable opponent leader name input (`<input>` with borderBottom-only style)

- [x] **[2026-05-06] Profile — collection completion % stat**
  - `profile/page.tsx`: `completionPct` computed from `collection` state when `showAllCards=true` data is loaded; amber stat chip rendered in profile header showing `XX.X% · N / M cards`

- [x] **[2026-05-06] Wishlist — full stack** (PR #3)
  - `backend/src/database/models.py`: `UserWishlist` model (`user_id` PK, `card_id` PK, `added_at`); relationships on `User.wishlist` and `Card.wishlist_entries`
  - `backend/src/routes/me.py`: `GET /me/wishlist`, `POST /me/wishlist` (idempotent), `DELETE /me/wishlist/{card_id}`; returns enriched card data
  - `frontend/src/app/api/me/wishlist/route.ts`: GET + POST Next.js proxy
  - `frontend/src/app/api/me/wishlist/[cardId]/route.ts`: DELETE proxy (correct Next.js 15 `Promise<params>` pattern)
  - `profile/page.tsx` Wishlist tab: replaced Coming Soon panel with live card grid (`WishlistCard` mini-cards with aspect-gradient backgrounds, ✕ remove button, empty state + Browse CTA)
  - `CardDetailDialog.tsx`: "☆ Add to Wishlist" / "★ On Wishlist" toggle button in dialog footer

- [x] **[2026-05-04] Repo integration — twin-suns-databases merged in**
  - `backup_db.py` → `backend/scripts/backup_db.py` (updated to use `DB_DIR`)
  - `.github/workflows/update_dbs.yaml` created (Monday 2 AM card DB rebuild)

  - TypeScript compiles clean

- [x] **[2026-05-05] Local dev smoke test — all pages and API flows verified**
  - `.env.dev` `PORT=8000` bug fixed — was causing Next.js to start on 8000, conflicting with uvicorn
  - Frontend `:3000`, backend `:8000`, all proxy routes verified (calls go through Next.js, not directly to FastAPI)
  - Cards page: 2,360 cards, all filter categories present (type, aspects, keywords, sets)
  - Deck builder: leaders load, `leadersShareAspects()` filtering logic confirmed in code
  - Auth: register, login, JWT token flow all work
  - Deck CRUD: create, read, delete verified via API
  - TypeScript: 0 errors

- [x] **[2026-05-04] Full production smoke test — stack operational at 192.168.1.124:4000**
- [x] JWT secret rotated on production server; `.env.prod` removed from git and gitignored
- [x] Production-side `DB_DIR` env var added to server compose (backend was falling back to `~/.swu`)
- [x] `types.py` import bug fixed on server: `get_app_db` → `get_card_db` (still needs git commit on server side — server source was patched in-place)
- [x] Old frontend image replaced: rewrote proxy approach from broken `localhost:8000` rewrites to route handlers; rebuilt image on TrueNAS
- [x] All frontend route handlers synced to TrueNAS (`rsync`); image rebuilt and deployed

## What's Next

**Priority order — top item is immediately actionable:**

0. **[BROWSER TEST] Login + full flow test on production** — `http://192.168.1.124:4000`. Test: login → cards page → double-click to add to collection → deck builder → create deck → profile page (decks, collection, wishlist tabs). Production API smoke test passed via curl; needs real browser login flow verified.

1. **[BROWSER TEST] Test double-click card add in deck builder** — Double-click handler exists (`handleCardDoubleClick`), leader filtering logic confirmed in code (`leadersShareAspects`). Manually double-click a leader, verify second leader grid filters to compatible aspects, proceed through base and cards stages.

2. **[REPO CLEANUP] — DONE** (session 4)
   - ~~`_cleanup_backup/`~~ — was already gone
   - `frontend/src/lib/utils.ts` — kept; still used by `src/components/ui/` shadcn components
   - ~~`backend/src/utils/vector_db.py`, `build_vector_db.py`, `rules_parser.py`~~ — deleted
   - `.env.prod` JWT secret in plaintext — known debt, documented below in Notes; no code change needed
   - `docker-compose.prod.yaml` — always-edit-on-disk approach confirmed; Portainer copies overwritten on each `./deploy.sh`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` — already not present in `.env.prod` or source; stale comment removed from `docker-compose.prod.yaml`

3. **[ENHANCEMENT] Add meaningful test coverage** — Current tests don't use standard pytest patterns. Add at minimum: auth endpoint tests, card search tests, deck CRUD tests.

---

## What's Blocked

- **AI/ML features** — No spec. ML stub files deleted (session 4). `requirements-ml.txt` retains the deps for when this is revisited. Block until product decision on what Phase 2 AI features actually look like.
- **Offline/PWA support** — Listed in README as planned. No progress. Not a priority until core features are stable.

---

## Failed Approaches

- **Docker multi-service troubleshooting** — Multiple iterations (`741860e` through `7d4eb33`) on getting Docker networking right. Key lesson: dev compose uses `twinsuns_network`, prod uses `twinsuns` — they are different and cannot be mixed. The `INTERNAL_API_URL` (container-to-container) vs `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` (browser-facing) distinction is critical and easy to swap accidentally.
- **Decks router** — The decks router was likely disabled to isolate a crash during the Docker troubleshooting phase. The variable name bug (`current_user` vs `get_current_user`) is probably the root cause. Do not simply uncomment — fix the bug first.

---

## Notes for Next Session

- **Deploy is now fully automated**: `./deploy.sh` builds, pushes to Docker Hub, and triggers Portainer redeploy. No manual steps. Portainer credentials are in `.env.prod`.
- **Production Portainer stack** is ID 94, endpointId 3, at `https://192.168.1.124:9004`. The compose file in Portainer is now synced with `docker-compose.prod.yaml` on disk. `deploy.sh` overwrites the Portainer compose on every deploy — so always edit on disk, not in the Portainer UI.
- **Portainer stack env vars** (set in Portainer UI, not the compose file): `JWT_SECRET`, `DATABASE_PATH`, `ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES`, `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`. These are preserved by `deploy.sh` (fetched via API and re-submitted). Don't add new required vars here without updating `deploy.sh` or the compose defaults.
- **Database layout on TrueNAS**: `swu_app.db` lives at `/mnt/volume1/docker/twinsuns/databases/app_db/swu_app.db`, card DB at `.../cards_db/swu_cards.db`. These paths are hardcoded in `docker-compose.prod.yaml` since they're TrueNAS-specific.
- `.env.prod` has real secrets (JWT secret, Portainer password). Do not `cat` in a shared screen.
- When testing decks, use Swagger at `:8000/docs` to test backend directly before testing via the frontend proxy.
- The `_cleanup_backup/` directory at project root is safe to delete — old pre-architecture files, nothing recoverable.
