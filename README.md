# Star Wars Unlimited Card Database & Browser

## Overview

SWU Deck Builder is a comprehensive tool for Star Wars Unlimited players, designed specifically to support the Twin Suns format. 

In the Twin Suns format, players build decks with distinctive rules:

- Each deck is built around a central Leader card (similar to a Commander in MTG)
- Only one copy of each card is allowed in a deck (unlike standard Star Wars Unlimited rules of 3-4 copies)
- The Leader defines the deck's core strategy and sets the deck's aspectual identity

## Project Goals
My mission is to support growth for the Star Wars Unlimited community, offering:

- Comprehensive card database
- Intuitive deck-building interface
- Advanced card search and filtering
- Future AI-powered deck analysis and playtesting

   - Added aspect compatibility checking for proper deck building rules
   - Created visual indicators for card selection and compatibility status
   - Implemented flip view for double-sided leader cards
   - Added deck statistics and validation

2. **User Interface Enhancements**:
   - Improved card detail display with aspect color coding
   - Enhanced card grid with selection indicators and type badges
   - Added responsive layout with resizable panels
   - Implemented stage progress indicators in deck builder

3. **Technical Improvements**:
   - Fixed TypeScript errors and improved type safety
   - Enhanced component organization and reusability
   - Improved error handling and state management
   - Added visual feedback for user actions

## Features

### Backend
- Fetches complete card data from the official Star Wars Unlimited API
- Handles all card types (Leaders, Bases, Units, Events, etc.)
- Stores both card faces for Leader cards
- Maintains relationships between cards and their aspects, keywords, traits, and arenas
- Includes price history tracking capability
- Provides detailed logging of the database building process
- Rate-limited API access to be respectful of the server

### Frontend
- Modern, responsive card browser interface
- Filter cards by type, aspect, and other attributes
- Search cards by name
- Detailed card view with full card information
- Dark mode support

### Technical Architecture

#### Database

- SQLite for structured card data storage
- Qdrant Vector Database for advanced semantic search (future AI features)

#### Technologies

- Frontend: Next.js, React
- Backend: FastAPI
- Database: SQLite, Qdrant

### Upcoming Features

- Deck saving and sharing
- User profiles
- AI-powered deck suggestions
- Deck strategy analysis
- Playtesting against AI opponents

## Getting Started

### Requirements
- Python 3.10 or higher
- Node.js 16 or higher
- SQLite3

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/starwarsunlimited-db-api.git
cd starwarsunlimited-db-api
```

2. Set up the backend:
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up the frontend:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

4. Build the database:
```bash
cd backend
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
python -m src.database.build_database
```

Note: The database will be created in your home directory at `~/.swu/swu_cards.db`

### Development

Run both frontend and backend servers in development mode:
```bash
./dev.sh
```

This will start:
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend API: http://localhost:8000

## Current Status and Known Issues

The project is actively under development. Please see the change log for more detailed progress notes. Current limitations include:


### Incomplete Functionality

- Deck building is not fully implemented
- Cannot save or share decks
- No user authentication


### User Interface

- Homepage is not yet user-friendly
- Limited navigation options, mainly /cards and /deck-builder


Features in Development

- AI deck suggestion system
- Comprehensive deck analysis
- Full vector database integration
- Playtesting decks


## Future Development

### Immediate Next Steps

1. **Fix Card Grid Layout**
   - Refactor the card grid component to ensure proper spacing and prevent overlap
   - Optimize for different screen sizes and card densities
   - Implement virtualization for better performance with large card collections

2. **Create Decks Page**
   - Develop a dedicated page for browsing and managing saved decks
   - Implement deck list with filtering and sorting capabilities
   - Add deck preview with statistics and aspect breakdown
   - Create interface for loading decks into the deck builder

3. **Improve Navigation**
   - Enhance main navigation with better styling and mobile responsiveness
   - Add breadcrumbs for improved context within the application
   - Improve active state indicators for current section

4. **Enhance Deck Builder**
   - Ensure leader cards always show flip side in detail view
   - Add deck saving and loading functionality
   - Implement deck sharing via URL
   - Add deck validation with clear feedback

5. **User Authentication**
   - Implement user registration and login
   - Add profile pages for user information
   - Create persistent deck storage for logged-in users

### AI Features Roadmap

The project plans to integrate advanced AI capabilities to enhance deck building and game analysis. This development will proceed in several phases:

#### Phase 1: Intelligent Card Analysis
- Implementation of vector search for semantic card relationships ✅
- AI-powered deck recommendations based on play patterns and card synergies
- Advanced filtering based on card mechanics and strategic roles

#### Phase 2: Deck Building Assistant
- Automated deck analysis for resource curve and strategy identification
- Synergy suggestions for deck improvement
- Performance predictions based on card combinations

#### Phase 3: Game State Analysis
- Implementation of game state tracking and analysis
- Basic AI opponent for deck testing
- Play pattern recognition and strategic suggestions

#### Phase 4: Advanced AI Features
- Deep learning integration for sophisticated strategy analysis
- Real-time play suggestions
- Deck performance optimization

Each phase will build upon the existing functionality while maintaining stability and usability. Detailed technical specifications for each phase will be published as implementation begins.
