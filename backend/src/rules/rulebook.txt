11/1/24 - V 3.0


This document is the comprehensive rulebook for Star Wars(tm): Unlimited, providing the most detailed explanation of the rules interactions found in the game. Its focus is on completeness rather than accessibility, and it is intended for judges and those who seek to understand the game on a fundamental level. To learn the game, we recommend reading the Quickstart rules, then referring to information on our website, StarWarsUnlimited.com, for further elaboration.
The rules in this document are organized by category, each having a unique number for ease of citation (for example, 1.1.2.). The document also features an Index/Glossary of important terms and phrases at the end with hyperlinks for quick reference. Red text marks additions/changes since the previous version.
If you need further clarifications of any part of this document, you may email us questions through our customer service page at FantasyFlightGames.com.

b. A player is the "controller" of a card they put into play. This includes their base, their leader, resources in their resource zone, and units, upgrades, and tokens they play or put into play. A player keeps control of a card until either that card leaves play or their opponent takes control of it.c. While a player controls a card, they may resolve action abilities on the card, attack with the card if it is a unit, and affect it with
abilities that affect "friendly" cards. A player also must resolve any triggered abilities on a card they control.d. If an ability instructs a player to "take control" of a card, that player will become that card's controller, and remain so until either that card leaves play or their opponent takes control of that card. The unit maintains its ready or exhausted status, all damage counters on it, and all upgrades attached to it. Its new controller orients it in its arena to face them.e. A player may play an upgrade onto an enemy unit. That player is still the controller of that upgrade, and remains so until otherwise
specified. If that upgrade gives abilities to the attached unit, the unit's controller resolves those abilities.f. If a player gives a token upgrade to an opponent's unit, that player is considered to own that token upgrade, not the opponent.









a. Cards that are in-play, including bases, tokens, units, upgrades, and resources, can be defeated.b. A base is defeated when it has damage on it equal to or greater than its HP. When a base is defeated, its owner loses the game.c. A unit is defeated when it has damage on it equal to or greater than its HP, or when an ability defeats it directly. When a non-leader unit is defeated, it is moved to its owner's discard pile. The unit's abilities are no longer considered active (though some delayed effects may still be active). The unit loses all abilities and modifiers it was given by effects while in play. When a leader unit is defeated, it is flipped to its Leader side and moved to its owner's base zone, exhausted.d. An upgrade is defeated when the unit it is attached to leaves play, or when an ability defeats it directly. When an upgrade is defeated, it is moved to its owner's discard pile. The upgrade's abilities are no longer considered active (though some delayed effects may still be active).e. A token is defeated in the same manner as its non-token card type. When a token is defeated, it is set aside out-of-play.f. A resource is defeated when an ability defeats it. When a resource is defeated, it is moved to its owner's discard pile faceup. When
a resource is defeated, it does not trigger any "When Defeated" abilities on the facedown side of the card.

7.	RESOURCES
A resource is a game object used to pay the costs of cards and certain abilities. A card becomes a resource when placed into a player's resource zone.

2. When paying a card's cost or the cost of an ability that uses a ??


icon, a player must exhaust ready resources they control equal to

the number indicated by the cost. An exhausted resource cannot be used to pay a cost.

3. Resources are placed facedown and remain facedown while in a player's resource zone. A player may view facedown resources they control at any time.

4. The number of ready and exhausted resources in a player's resource zone is public information. The order of those resources does not need to be maintained; a player may rearrange their resources at any time, so long as the number of ready and exhausted resources is the same after rearrangement as prior to rearrangement. A player may rearrange their resources after another player declares their intent to interact with those resources.

5. If a player controls cards in their resource zone that are owned by an opponent, the ownership of those cards is open information.
6. Players can choose to add a card from their hand to their resource zone during each regroup phase. See 5.5. Regroup Phase
7. If an ability instructs a player to put a card into play as a resource, the card is placed facedown and exhausted in that player's
resource zone unless otherwise specified. The card is not considered "played" and no "When Played" abilities trigger.

8. While a card is in play as a resource, it is considered a blank resource card. Its facedown side is considered out-of-play, and its printed attributes-including its name, aspects, traits, and abilities-are inactive and do not affect the game unless explicitly stated in the ability or the associated rules text (as with Smuggle).

For example, a player can control one copy of a unique card faceup in an arena, as well as another copy of that unique card facedown as a resource, without needing to defeat one of those copies as per the rules of uniqueness.

cost must be taken into account when paying for the cost of a card; if the player cannot pay a card's cost, they cannot play the card.

3. Any modifiers to a card's cost are cumulative. When calculating modified cost, any modifiers that increase cost are applied before any modifiers that decrease cost.

4. A card's cost cannot be modified below 0. If an ability would cause the cost of a card to be modified below 0, treat that card as having 0 cost instead.

5. If an ability instructs a player to play a card "for free," the player bypasses all modifiers to that card's cost (including the aspect penalty), and does not pay any resources to play that card. The player must still pay any additional non-resource costs applied to the card.

6. If an ability refers to the "cost" of a card, that ability always refers to the printed cost of the card. It does not take into account any modifiers to the card's cost as it was played. See 8.16. Modifiers

For example, Andre has Admiral Piett (SOR #079) in play, who has an ability that gives Ambush to friendly units that cost 6 or more. Andre plays Galactic Ambition (SOR #235) to play Relentless (SOR #089) for free. Although Andre didn't spend any resources to play Relentless, its printed cost is still 9, which means that Admiral Piett will still give it Ambush.

7. Each leader's Leader Unit side has a printed cost equal to the number of resources required to deploy it, even though deploying that leader doesn't require spending resources. Once deployed, card abilities that affect units with a specific cost can also affect a Leader Unit in play with that cost.

8. Some abilities add an "additional cost" to play a card, applying a non-resource cost to that card. In order to play that card, a player
must both pay the card's cost in resources, and all additional costs applied to the card.

For example, Saw Gerrera (SOR #153) has an ability that requires each opponent to pay an "additional cost" to play an event, dealing 2 damage to their base. If Saw Gerrera is controlled by Ken's opponent, and Ken wanted to play Vanquish (SOR #078), he would have to pay 5 resources and deal 2 damage to his base in order to play Vanquish.

9. Some cards have action abilities with an ability cost, indicated in brackets following the word "Action." In order to use such an ability, the player who controls the card with the ability must pay the cost in brackets. This cost may include various forms of payment such as spending resources, exhausting cards, or defeating friendly units. Resolving an action ability this way counts as the player's action for the turn.

For example, Emperor Palpatine: Galactic Ruler (SOR #006) has an action ability on his Leader side with an ability cost indicated in brackets. In order to use the ability, Palpatine's controller must first pay the full cost of the ability: paying 1 resource, exhausting Palpatine, and defeating a friendly unit. After paying this cost, the controller resolves the ability's effect.

10. If a replacement effect replaces part or all of a cost with another effect, the cost is still considered paid as long as that other effect can be resolved. If a replacement effect can't be resolved, the original cost must be paid in full.

9. DAMAGE
Cards with HP values (units and bases) can be dealt damage by attacks and abilities. Damage dealt is represented by damage counters.

2. When damage is dealt to a card, place that many damage counters on that card.
3. When damage is healed from a card, remove that many damage counters from that card. If the damage healed exceeds the damage that was on the card, remove as much damage as possible instead. An effect only is considered to have healed a unit if at least one damage counter is removed.

4. A card is considered "damaged" if it has at least 1 damage counter on it.
5. Damage is persistent. Damage counters remain on cards until either the card leaves play, or the damage is healed. When a card with damage on it leaves play, remove any damage counters that were on that card.

6. If a unit has damage on it equal to or greater than its HP value, that unit is immediately defeated.
7. If a base has damage on it equal to or greater than its HP value, its owner immediately loses the game, and their opponent wins the game.

8. If an ability deals damage to multiple units, all damage is dealt simultaneously. If an ability deals multiple instances of damage to one unit, each instance of damage is dealt sequentially. Resolve any triggered abilities after all damage is dealt.

9. If an ability prevents damage from being dealt to a unit or base, no damage is considered dealt to that unit or base, and abilities that trigger when damage is dealt don't trigger.

c. If a player takes the initiative on the turn immediately after their opponent passes, the action phase ends.d. If no player takes the initiative during the action phase, the player with the initiative keeps control of it and starts the next round as
the first active player.To pass, a player declares that they are passing.a. When a player passes, they are considered to have done nothing during their action.b. A player may pass even if there are other actions available for them to take.c. A player must notify their opponent when they pass (such as by saying "I pass" or making a clear gesture). Once the player does so, their opponent becomes the active player and takes a turn (unless both players have passed consecutively, in which case the action phase ends).d. When each player has passed consecutively (including when one player takes the initiative after their opponent passes), the action phase immediately ends and play proceeds to the regroup phase.

6. UPGRADE
An upgrade is a type of card that attaches to a unit. Each upgrade has a name, cost, trait(s), power modifier, and HP modifier. An
upgrade may also have aspect icons, abilities, and a unique icon (?) before its name.

2. To play an upgrade, pay the upgrade's cost-following any additional costs or play restrictions in effect for that upgrade-and attach it to a unit in play. When attaching an upgrade, tuck the upgrade halfway under the unit so that the upgrade's ability and modifiers can be seen clearly. See 6.2. Play a Card

3. An upgrade may specify that it must "attach to" a specific type of unit. This is considered a play restriction for that upgrade. If there is no unit of the specific type in play for the upgrade to attach to, the upgrade cannot be played. If there are no units in play, no upgrades can be played.

a. A unit is considered "eligible" for an upgrade if that upgrade can attach to it. A unit's eligibility is only checked as the upgrade is being played. If an upgrade attaches to a unit that later becomes ineligible for that upgrade, the upgrade remains attached to that unit.

4. There is no limit to the number of upgrades that can be attached to a unit. An upgrade can only attach to one unit at a time.
5. Upgrades may be played on friendly units or enemy units. If a player plays an upgrade onto an enemy unit, that player still controls the upgrade. If that upgrade gives abilities to the attached unit, the unit's controller resolves those abilities.

6. When an upgrade is attached to a unit, the unit also is attached to that upgrade. If an upgrade becomes unattached from a unit, the unit also becomes unattached from that upgrade.

7. Each upgrade has a power modifier and HP modifier. A unit's power and HP are cumulatively modified by each upgrade attached to it.

For example, if a unit originally has 1 power and 3 HP, then receives two Experience token upgrades, those upgrades will modify that unit's power and HP positively, resulting in the unit having 3 power and 5 HP.

8. Some upgrades give abilities to the unit they're attached to. If an upgrade's text box uses the phrase "attached unit gains _," the text following "gains" is considered an ability that the attached unit has while the upgrade is attached to it, and such an ability can be lost, ignored, or affected by other abilities.

For example, Protector (SOR #057) has the text "Attached unit gains Sentinel" in its text box. The unit Protector is attached to is considered to have the Sentinel keyword while Protector is attached to it. If Protector is defeated, the attached unit immediately loses Sentinel. Additionally, the attached unit's opponent could play SpecForce Soldier (SOR #140) and cause the attached unit to lose Sentinel for the phase.

9. If a unit has multiple attached upgrades that give the same ability, it gains that ability multiple times. Keyword abilities do not "stack"
(meaning, the card does not gain any additional effects) unless those keywords are followed by a numeral.

10. Some upgrades have abilities that affect the unit they're attached to, but do not give the attached unit an ability. Such abilities refer
to the attached unit but do not use the phrase "attached unit gains."

For example, Entrenched (SOR #072) has the ability: "Attached unit can't attack bases." This ability affects the attached unit, but it is not an ability given to the unit. If the attached unit loses all abilities (such as by Force Lightning, SOR #138), the ability on Entrenched would still be in effect.

11. An upgrade is defeated when either the unit it is attached to leaves play, or when an ability defeats it directly. When an upgrade is defeated, the attached unit loses all power, HP, and abilities given to it by the upgrade, and the upgrade is placed in its owner's discard pile.

7. TOKEN
A token is a type of card that also has a second type, such as a "token upgrade" or "token unit." Each token has the same formatting
as its non-token card type.

2. Tokens are set aside at the start of the game. They cannot be shuffled into decks, discarded, or enter out-of-play zones. Tokens are "created" rather than "played" (meaning they don't trigger abilities that depend on a card being played), but are still considered to enter play when created and leave play when defeated. Tokens are considered to have a cost of 0.

3. If a token would leave play for any reason, set it aside instead. It is still considered to have left play.
4. There is no limit on tokens available to a player. A player may substitute any available object (such as dice) for a token.
5. An Experience token is a type of token upgrade. An Experience token is an upgrade with the LEARNED trait that gives the unit it is attached to +1 power and +1 HP. If a unit has multiple Experience tokens attached, it will receive bonus power and bonus HP from each Experience token. When an ability instructs a player to give an Experience token to a unit, they take an Experience token that has been set aside and attach it to that unit.

6. A Shield token is a type of token upgrade. A Shield token is an upgrade with the ARMOR trait that gives the unit it is attached to +0 power and +0 HP and has the text: "If damage would be dealt to attached unit, prevent that damage. If you do, defeat a Shield token on it." When an ability instructs a player to give a Shield token to a unit, they take a Shield token that has been set aside and attach it to that unit.

7. A Battle Droid token is a type of token unit. A Battle Droid token is a ground unit with the SEPARATIST, DROID, and TROOPER traits that has a Villainy aspect symbol ( ???? ), 1 power, and 1 HP.

8. A Clone Trooper token is a type of token unit. A Clone Trooper token is a ground unit with the REPUBLIC, CLONE, and TROOPER traits that has a Heroism aspect symbol ( ???? ), 2 power, and 2 HP.

Pay cost(s). Exhaust resources equal to the card's modified cost. If there are any additional costs required for the card, also pay
those now.a. If any costs (including resource costs and additional costs) cannot be paid, cease this process without paying any costs. Return the
game state to the way it was before the first step.b. A player cannot pay resources in excess of a card's modified cost.c. If a replacement effect replaces a cost with another effect, the cost is still considered paid as long as that other effect is resolved.d. A player may pay costs in any order, so long as all costs are paid.Put card into play/discard.
a. If the card is a unit, put it into play in its designated arena (ground or space), exhausted.b. If the card is an upgrade, put it into play attached to an eligible unit.c. If the card is an event, place the event in its owner's discard pile, then resolve its ability. Resolve as much of its ability as possible and ignore any parts of the ability that cannot resolve.d. The card is considered "played" as soon as it enters play or, in the case of events, the discard pile.

b. Only one unit may attack at a time, and only ready units may perform an attack, unless otherwise specified. A player may only attack with units they control and may only attack enemy units or enemy bases. If an attacking player loses control of the attacker or gains control of the defender during an attack, proceed directly to the completion of the attack (after resolving any abilities that have already triggered). These restrictions apply even if the attack is prompted by another ability. If an ability triggers multiple attacks, resolve them sequentially.c. "Combat damage" is damage dealt during the "Deal combat damage" step of an attack. Damage dealt outside of this step during an
attack is not considered to be combat damage. Damage dealt by triggered abilities is not considered combat damage.d. Some action, event, and triggered abilities allow a player to attack with a unit. When resolving an ability that allows a player to attack with a unit, the player must make an attack if possible. The player is not considered to have taken an additional action if they attack due to an ability.e. Attacking With a Unit consists of the following 3 steps in order, explained in detail below: Declare the attack, Deal combat damage, and Complete the attack. After each step, resolve any abilities triggered during that step before proceeding to the next step in the attack. See 7.6. Triggered AbilitiesDeclare the attack. The active player chooses and exhausts a ready unit they control and then chooses what to attack: either an
enemy unit in the same arena as it or the opponent's base. Any abilities that are active "while attacking" become active.
a. If an ability prompts an attack, apply any "for this attack" lasting effects of the ability. If the effect impacts what the attacker can attack, the player must choose a eligible unit or base to attack. If no such choice can be made, the attack immediately ends. If an effect is contingent on which defender is chosen, the effect applies as soon as the defender is declared.b. Only exhaust the attacker if there is an enemy unit or base that it can attack. If there is nothing for the attacker to attack, cease the
attack and return the game state to the way it was before this step.c. The active player becomes the "attacking player" and the opponent that controls the enemy unit or base being attacked becomes the "defending player" for this attack.d. The unit performing the attack becomes the "attacker" for this attack. If the attacker is attacking an enemy unit, that unit becomes the "defender" for this attack and the attacker is considered to be "attacking a unit" for the duration of this attack. If the attacker
is attacking a base, there is no "defender" for this attack and the attacker is considered to be "attacking a base" for the duration of
this attack.

e. If the defending player has one or more units with Sentinel in the same arena as the attacker, one of those units must be chosen as the defender, unless the attacker has Saboteur, in which case it may ignore Sentinel.f. Any abilities that activate while an attack is occurring become active for the duration of the attack. This includes Raid, "While this unit is attacking," and "While this unit is defending" abilities. If the ability is subject to a further conditional (e.g. "While this unit is attacking a damaged unit"), it is only active while all of its conditions are true.g. After declaring the attack, resolve any "On Attack" abilities on the attacker and any other abilities triggered during this step,
including Restore, Saboteur, and "When this unit is attacked" abilities on the defender. See 7.6. Triggered AbilitiesDeal combat damage. If attacking a base, the attacker deals damage equal to its power to that base. If attacking a unit, the attacker and defender simultaneously deal damage equal to their power to each other.a. If the attacker is no longer in-play, no combat damage is dealt. Proceed directly to the next step of this attack.b. If the defender is no longer in-play, no combat damage is dealt unless the attacker has Overwhelm.c. If either unit that would be dealt damage has one or more Shield tokens attached to it, remove a Shield token from that unit and don't deal it any combat damage.d. If the attacker has Overwhelm, deal its excess damage to the opponent's base, unless the defender had a Shield token that prevented the damage. This excess damage is dealt immediately and is considered combat damage. See 1.9. Damage





b. Action abilities are abilities that begin with the bold word "Action" or "Epic Action" followed by a cost in brackets, a colon, and an
ability following the colon.c. In order to use an action ability, a player must be able to pay the ability's cost if it has one and change the game state through paying that ability's cost and/or resolving that ability's effect.d. A player may use an action ability whose effect does not change the game state, as long as paying the ability's cost or resolving the ability changes the game state.e. A player may use an action ability that references a particular kind of unit even if no such unit is in play, as long as paying the ability's cost or resolving the ability changes the game state.

1. GENERAL
An ability is specialized game text that indicates how a card affects the game. If a card has any printed abilities, they are found in the text box of that card. An upgrade can give an ability to a unit if that upgrade indicates that the attached unit "gains" the ability; treat the unit as having the ability in its text box for as long as the upgrade is attached to it. Unless otherwise specified, a player controls the abilities on cards they play and control.

2. There are five types of abilities: action abilities, constant abilities, event abilities, keyword abilities, and triggered abilities. Each
type of ability has its own associated rules.

3. An effect is a non-cost part of a card ability that has the potential to change the game state. Some effects resolve separately from the ability that created them, or replace the standard resolution of the ability that created them.

4. If an ability that affects both players can be resolved simultaneously, resolve the ability simultaneously. Otherwise, the player that
controls the card with the ability can choose the order in which each player is affected by the ability.

For example, Grand Admiral Thrawn (SOR #016) has an ability where his controller looks at the top card of each player's deck. This ability cannot be resolved simultaneously, so Thrawn's controller chooses the order in which they look at the cards. They are not required to look at the cards in a specific order.

5. When a player resolves an ability, they must resolve the effects of that ability in the order they are written. If an ability allows a player to choose some number of options, they may resolve those options in any order.

6. Abilities that Modify Actions

a. Some abilities instruct the controlling player to take an action ("Play a card," "Attack with a unit," or "Use an Action Ability"), often with additional effects attached; such an ability is considered a "modified action." A modified action is resolved as though the player had taken the corresponding action, with any modifiers applied as appropriate. The player must perform the action if possible (unless it involves hidden information, as with "Play a card from your hand") and complete each step of the action in order, applying any modifiers during the appropriate step.b. A modified "Play a Card" action might include: restrictions on the type of card that can be played, cost adjustments, playing cards from other zones, or other effects. Any abilities triggered during or as a result of a modified "Play a Card" action are resolved after the current ability is finished resolving.c. A modified "Attack With a Unit" action might include: restrictions on what can be attacked, temporary modifiers or keywords to
apply, or other effects. Any abilities triggered during the attack are resolved at the appropriate timing windows of that attack.d. A modified "Use an Action Ability" action might include a restriction on how that action ability is used, or other effects. Any abilities triggered during or as a result of a modified "Use an Action Ability" action are resolved after the current ability is finished resolving.

a. "Ambush" is a keyword whose effect is the same as the triggered ability: "When Played: If there is an enemy unit that this unit can
attack, you may ready this unit and attack that enemy unit."b. Multiple instances of Ambush do not stack. If a unit gains Ambush multiple times, it may only ready and attack a unit once.c. A unit with Ambush still enters play exhausted like any other (non-leader) unit and cannot ready if there are no enemy units it can attack.d. Ambush resolves during the same window as any "When Played" abilities on the unit.e. An attack resulting from Ambush is resolved like any other attack, with all of the same steps. See 6.3.

b. Multiple instances of Overwhelm do not stack.c. An attacker with Overwhelm deals combat damage to the defender and the enemy base simultaneously.d. When an attacker with Overwhelm deals excess damage to a base, it is considered to have dealt combat damage to the base, but it is not considered to have attacked that base.e. If an attacker with Overwhelm would deal combat damage to a defender that has a Shield token, the Shield token is defeated and no damage is dealt to the enemy base.f.  If an attacker with Overwhelm does not defeat the defender while attacking, no damage is dealt to the enemy base.g. If the defender is defeated before an attacker with Overwhelm deals combat damage (e.g. by an "On Attack" ability), all of the attacker's combat damage is considered excess damage and dealt to the enemy base, though the unit is not considered to have attacked that base.

a. "Sentinel" is a keyword whose effect is the same as the constant ability: "Units in this arena can't attack your non-Sentinel units
or your base. Abilities this unit gains can't prevent this unit from being attacked."b. When a player makes an attack, after exhausting the attacker, the player checks if there are any enemy units in the attacker's arena with Sentinel. If there are one or more, the attacking player cannot choose a non-Sentinel unit as the defender (unless the attacker has Saboteur). If their opponent controls multiple units with Sentinel in that arena, the attacking player may choose any one of those units to be the defender.c. If the attacker has the Saboteur keyword, its controller ignores the Sentinel keyword on enemy units in the attacker's arena, and may choose to attack any unit in the same arena or the opponent's base. (Enemy units do not lose Sentinel while Sentinel is ignored.)d. If a unit has Sentinel and an ability where it "can't be attacked," Sentinel overrides that ability, and that unit can be attacked.








a. "Bounty" is a keyword followed by an em dash and ability text whose effect is the same as the triggered ability: "When Defeated/ When Captured: Resolve the following ability," except that the triggered ability is considered controlled by an opponent.b. Each Bounty ability on a unit is considered an independent ability. A unit can have multiple Bounty abilities and can be given the same Bounty ability multiple times.c. Bounty resolves in the same window as any "When Defeated" or "When Captured" abilities on the unit.d. To "collect a Bounty" is to resolve a triggered Bounty ability.e. Resolving a Bounty ability is optional. If a player chooses not to resolve a Bounty ability, they are not considered to have collected that Bounty.f. Bounty abilities are always resolved by an opponent. If a player defeats their own unit that has a Bounty ability, they must choose an opponent to resolve its Bounty ability.g. If playing with more than two players, the opponent who defeats/captures a unit with Bounty must be chosen as the opponent who may collect that Bounty. See 11. Playing With More than Two Players

7. A triggered ability must resolve once its triggering condition is met unless the ability uses the phrase "you may." Once triggered,
these abilities must resolve at the next available opportunity.

8. If an ability triggers during or as the result of a non-attack action, resolve that ability at the next available opportunity after that action is fully completed. If an ability triggers during an attack, resolve that ability at the appropriate timing point within that attack. Resolving a triggered ability never interrupts an action or ability that is currently resolving (other than the specified timing points during an attack). See 6.3. Attack With a Unit

9. If a player must resolve multiple triggered abilities on cards they control at the same time, that player chooses the order in which to resolve those abilities.

10. If both players must resolve triggered abilities on cards they control at the same time, the active player chooses one player at a time to resolve abilities. When chosen, that player resolves all abilities triggered on cards they control in the order of their choice, and once they finish, the other player does the same on cards they control.

For example, if the active player Addy defeats Benji's unit with an attack, and Addy then has 1 triggered ability to resolve while Benji has 2, Addy chooses whether she resolves her 1 ability first, or Benji resolves his 2 first. Addy can only choose which player resolves their abilities first; she cannot choose the order in which Benji resolves his 2 abilities.

11. After resolving a triggered ability "A", if any new abilities were triggered while resolving it, the new abilities are considered "nested abilities" and must be resolved before any other abilities triggered at the same time as ability "A".

12. Any abilities triggered while resolving a nested ability are likewise nested abilities, and must be resolved before other triggered abilities waiting to resolve. When resolving a series of nested abilities, each new layer of abilities must be fully resolved before returning to an earlier layer.

For example, Grayson chooses to attack Mimi's Vanguard Infantry (SOR #108) with his Greedo (SOR #204). Both units are defeated, simultaneously triggering the When Defeated abilities on each. Since Grayson is the active player, he gets to decide which player will resolve their triggers first. He chooses himself, and manages to use Greedo's When Defeated ability to defeat another of Mimi's units, Admiral Motti (SOR #226), that has its own When Defeated ability. Admiral Motti's ability is a nested ability, since it triggered during the resolution of Greedo's ability, so it must be resolved next. Only after readying a unit with Admiral Motti's ability may Mimi resolve Vanguard Infantry's When Defeated ability from the earlier ability layer.

6.	COPY










A card is considered a "copy" of another card if both cards have all of the same printed attributes: the same name, subtitle, uniqueness, card type, arena type, cost, aspect(s), trait(s), power or power modifier, HP or HP modifier, and abilities. Disregard any reminder text when evaluating whether two cards are "copies" of one another.


2. A card may have the same name as another card, but otherwise have one or more different printed attributes; these cards are not considered copies of each other.

3. Printed attributes are what determine if a card is a copy of another card. Ignore any modifiers, abilities, or effects applied to a card
when determining if it is a copy of another card.

4. Whenever a card leaves and later re-enters play, it is considered a "new copy" of that card for the purposes of game rules and does not regain any modifiers or reapply any effects from when it was previously in play. It continues to be considered a new copy even if it changes zones.

For example, Regional Governor (SOR #062) has an ability that says "When Played: Name a card. While this unit is in play, opponents can't play the named card." If Regional Governor is defeated and later replayed from the discard pile, its "When Played" ability would trigger again, but it would not resume preventing opponents from playing the originally chosen card.

5. A player may have up to 3 copies of any non-leader, non-base card in their deck, regardless of if that card is unique or not.
6. A player can only control 1 copy of each unique card at a given time. If a player ever has more than one copy of a unique card in play under their control at a given time, they must immediately defeat one of them. (This occurs before resolving any abilities that trigger when the new copy enters play.) The player still resolves any abilities that trigger upon the copy being defeated in this way, such as any "When Defeated" abilities on it. If a new copy with a "When Played" ability enters play and is immediately defeated, the ability is still triggered.

7. A player may control any number of copies of a non-unique card at a given time.

16.	MODIFIERS
A "modifier" refers to a change of a printed value on a card through an ability applied to that card or an upgrade attached to that card. When a modifier is applied to a printed value, it creates a modified value, which in turn is used when resolving abilities or actions that depend on that value. The modified value of a card is considered open information to both players.

An example of a modifier is "Give a unit +1/+1 for this phase," which modifies a unit's power and HP until the end of the phase.

2. When calculating a modified value, start with the printed value, then apply any modifiers that increase that value before any modifiers that decrease that value.

3. Modifiers are cumulative. Any time a new modifier is applied to a value, the value is recalculated immediately, accounting for the printed value and all active modifiers.

4. A value cannot be modified below 0. If a value would be modified below 0, treat that value as 0 instead. However, any new modifiers applied after a value is treated as 0 will still account for any previous modifiers applied to that value.

For example, Keith plays Make an Opening (SOR #076) and gives his opponent's Cantina Braggart (SOR #157) -2/-2 for the phase. Cantina Braggart's printed power is 0, and though its power was modified by -2, its power is still treated as 0. If Keith's opponent then attacks with Cantina Braggart, its Raid 2 gives it +2/+0, but the -2/-2 applied to it that phase is still accounted for, and Cantina Braggart attacks with 0 total power.

5. Modifying Cost

a. A card's cost can be modified through abilities. Any modifiers to a card's cost must be applied when paying for the cost of the card; if the player cannot pay the card's modified cost, they cannot play that card.

f. A player may draft any card and does not need to choose cards that match the aspects of their drafted leaders (though that may result in having to pay the aspect penalty if they include those cards in their deck).

3. Steps of a Draft

a. Drafting Leaders
• Each participating player starts with three unopened packs from one Star Wars: Unlimited set.
• Each player partially opens each of their three packs, taking care to remove just the leader card on top of each pack and not to
look at any other cards in those packs.
• Each player chooses one of the leaders to keep in front of them as part of their draft pool. They then pass the remaining
leaders to the player to their right.
• Players repeat the previous step, choosing one of the leaders to keep and passing the other to their right. Each player adds the
last leader passed to them to their draft pool and should now have three leaders each.

b. Drafting Remaining Cards
• Each player takes one of the three partially-opened packs in front of them and views all of the cards from it, keeping the cards secret from other players. (Set the token from the pack aside; it is not drafted). Each player chooses one of the cards from the pack and adds it to their draft pool, then passes the remaining cards from the pack to the player to their left.
• Players repeat the previous step with the cards passed to them-viewing the group of cards, adding one to their draft pool, and passing the rest-until each card has been placed in a draft pool and no more cards can be passed.
• Once all cards from the first packs have been drafted, players repeat this process with the remaining packs. When drafting the second pack, each player passes the remaining cards to their right instead of their left. For the third pack, each player passes to their left again.
• After drafting all cards, each player uses the cards in their draft pool to build a draft deck.
4. Deckbuilding

a. A draft deck must include:
• Exactly 1 leader
• Exactly 1 base
• A minimum of 30 other cards (consisting of units, events, and upgrades)b. A player must use one of the three leaders that they drafted for their deck.c. A player may use any base that they drafted for their deck, or they may use a Common-rarity base with 30 HP and no ability that
they own or borrow.d. There is no limit to the number of copies of a single card (non-leader, non-base) that a player may include in their deck. If a player drafts four or more copies of the same card, they may use all of those copies.

a. Players may not choose the Pass action available in other formats in place of taking a different action. In the Twin Suns format, players may only pass if there are no counters available to take and must pass if they took a counter earlier in the round.b. Once a player has taken a counter, that player cannot take any additional actions for the phase, and must pass any time they would
take an action. A player cannot take a counter if they already took one that phase, or if all counters were already taken that phase.c. Note that in a three-player game, the third player will necessarily take the last counter, ending the phase. In a four-player game, once all three counters have been taken, the last remaining player may pass to end the phase when they either cannot or choose not to take any other actions.Any player who eliminates another player (such as by being the last player to damage the eliminated player's base) immediately heals 5 damage from their own base. If a player eliminates themself through an ability, no player heals damage from their base this way.

The following index and glossary contains brief summaries of terms discussed in the Comprehensive Rules. For more in-depth rules and clarifications, see the indicated rule number after each entry. This index and glossary is intended for quick reference only; rulings in the Comprehensive Rules above take precedence over any summary found below.

An ability is special text on a card that explains how the card can affect the game. A card may have one or more abilities printed in its text box, or gain an ability from other cards in play. Abilities must be resolved as fully as possible. See 1.3.2. for more on "Do As Much As You Can" & 1.6. Abilities

An action ability is an ability indicated by the bolded word "Action." Most action abilities have a cost in brackets that must be paid in order to use the ability.
Using an action ability is one type of action a player can take during their turn. See 7.2. Action Abilities

Each game round is made up of two phases: an action phase and a regroup phase. During an action phase, players take turns taking actions. See 5.4. Action  Phase

The active player is the player that is currently taking an action. Players take turns being the active player during the action phase. See 1.4. Players, Active  Player

Some abilities add an additional cost to play a card, applying a non-resource cost to that card. In order to play that card, a player must pay both the card's cost in resources, and all additional costs applied to the card. See 1.8.8. for more on additional costs

After a unit with the Ambush keyword is played, its controller may ready it and use it to attack an enemy unit. See 7.5.5. Ambush

A card with an ability that uses "other" or "another" cannot apply the effects of its ability to itself. Additionally, an ability may use "other" or "another" to separate the first card it affects from a different card that it affects. See 8.19. Other, Another

There are two arenas in the game: the ground arena and the space arena. Each arena is its own zone shared by players. A unit's arena type indicates which
arena it is played into. See 4.3. Ground Arena & See 4.4. Space Arena

Aspects are colored icons on a card that represent a different philosophy or motivation that card embodies. The six aspects and their associated colors are: Vigilance ???? , Command ???? , Aggression ???? , Cunning ???? , Villainy ???? , and Heroism ???? . See 1.5.6. Aspects

When a player plays a card with one or more aspect icons beyond the aspect icons provided by their leader and/or base, they incur the aspect penalty, and must pay 2 resources for each missing icon. See 8.1. Aspect Penalty

Upgrades are put into play attached to units. When an upgrade is attached to a unit, the unit is attached to that upgrade. See 3.6. Upgrade

As an action or through certain abilities, a player may attack with a unit by exhausting a unit they control to be "the attacker" and choosing what it attacks: either a "defender" or the opponent's base. See 6.3. Attack With a Unit

An attacker is a unit chosen to make an attack. See 6.3. Attack With a Unit

An attribute is a part of a card's anatomy. Attributes include a card's name, subtitle, card type, arena type, cost, aspect(s), power, power modifier, HP, HP modifier, trait(s), and/or text box. A card's attributes can be modified through upgrades and abilities. See 8.3. Attribute
Each deck has 1 base, which represents a location in the Star Wars universe. If a player's base is defeated, that player loses the game. See 3.2. Base
Each player has their own base zone, which contains their base and their leader when the leader isn't deployed. See 4.2. Base Zone
The blast counter is an additional counter added in the Twin Suns format used to end a player's participation in a round. When a player takes the blast counter, they immediately deal 1 damage to each opponent's base. See 12.5. Counters
When a player's unit with a Bounty is defeated or captured, an opponent gets to collect its Bounty and resolve its ability. See 7.5.13. Bounty
When "can" is used in a card ability, that ability adjusts or overrides a default rule of play. The player controlling a card with such an ability is able to choose whether to use that ability in the way specified or follow the default rule of play instead. See 1.3.3. for more on "Restrictions Override Permissions" & 8.4. "Can"  and "Can't"
If the word "can't" is used in an ability or rule it overrides permissions. If an ability with the word "may" or "can" directly contradicts an ability that uses the word "can't", then the ability that uses "can't" takes precedence. See 1.3.3. for more on "Restrictions Override Permissions" & 8.4. "Can" and "Can't"
When a unit captures another unit, the captured unit is removed from play and placed facedown under the capturing unit, which is now guarding it. The captured unit is rescued when the unit guarding it is removed from play. See 8.34. Capture
A card's type is located in the top left corner of the card. There are six different types of cards: bases, events, leaders, units, upgrades, and tokens. Each type
of card has its own associated rules. A resource is not considered a type of card. See 3. Card Types
When an ability instructs a player to "choose" a game object, they must select a game object that matches the criteria specified by the ability. When an event ability instructs a player to "choose" a number of multiple bulleted options, they must choose a different option each time. See 8.5. Choose
Combat damage is damage dealt during Step 2 of an attack. Combat damage is both the damage an attacker deals to a defender/base, and the damage a defender deals to an attacker. See 6.3. Attack With a Unit
Abilities with a triggering condition of "When this unit completes an attack" trigger during Step 3 of an attack. The unit with the ability must survive the
attack for the ability to trigger. See 6.3. Attack With a Unit
A constant ability is always in effect while the card it is on is in play, regardless of if that card is ready or exhausted. A constant ability may require a condition to be met for it to affect the game. See 7.3. Constant Abilities
A player is the controller of any card they played or put into play, unless another player used an ability to take control of such a card. Control of a card is constant; if a player takes control of a card, they remain the controller of that card until otherwise specified. See 1.5.2. Ownership and Control & 8.28. Take  Control

A Coordinate ability on a card is active while that card's controller controls 3 or more units. See 7.5.15. Coordinate

A card is a copy of another card if both cards have all of the same printed attributes. See 8.6. Copy

A card's cost indicates how many resources must be spent to play the card. See 1.8. Cost

Cards with HP values can be dealt damage by attacks and abilities. Damage is represented by damage counters. See 1.9. Damage

A player's deck is the collection of cards that they use to play the game. Each player's deck is its own zone. See 1.2. Deck

Deckbuilding rules vary based on the format being played. See 9.2. Premier Format, 10.2. Sealed Format, 10.3. Draft Format, & 12.2. Deckbuilding (Twin Suns).

A card is defeated when it leaves play, either when it has no remaining HP or an ability defeats it directly. See 1.5.5. Defeating Cards

A defender is a unit in combat being attacked. See 6.3. Attack With a Unit

A defending player is the controller of a unit or base being attacked. See 6.3. Attack With a Unit

A delayed effect is created when a card ability indicates a future timing point or a future condition that may arise and an effect that will happen at that time. Once created, a delayed effect will resolve at the specified timing point or condition, even if the ability that created it was on a card that left play. See 7.7.4.  Delayed Effect

To deploy a leader, flip it to its Leader Unit side, ready it, and move it from the base zone to the ground arena. A deployed leader can attack, be attacked, and
use the abilities on its Leader Unit side. See 3.4. Leader

To discard a card means to move it to its owner's discard pile from another zone, usually from a player's hand or deck. See 1.14. Discarding a Card

Each player has a discard pile, and each discard pile is its own zone. Played events, defeated (non-leader) units, defeated upgrades, and discarded cards are
placed in a player's discard pile, faceup. See 4.8. Discard Pile

The draft format is a two-player game format that uses limited deckbuilding. To build a draft deck, each player in a group opens three booster packs from a single Star Wars: Unlimited set and drafts their contents, first by drafting three leaders from those packs, then by drafting the rest of the cards from those packs. Once all cards have been drafted, each player creates a deck using their draft pool. See 10.3. Draft Format

To draw a card, a player moves the top card of their deck into their hand, unless otherwise specified. See 1.13. Drawing a Card

An effect is a non-cost part of a card ability that has the potential to change the game state. Some effects resolve separately from the ability that created them or replace the standard resolution of the ability that created them. See 7.7. Effects
If a player runs out of cards in their deck, they continue playing with the cards they have in play and in hand. If a player would draw a card from their empty deck, they instead deal 3 damage to their base for each card they would draw. See 8.7. Empty Deck
A card that a player's opponent controls is considered an "enemy" card for that player. See 1.5.3. Friendly and Enemy
A card enters play when it moves from an out-of-play zone to an in-play zone (for example, when a unit is played from a player's hand into the ground arena) or when it is turned faceup. See 8.8. Enters Play
An Epic Action ability is a type of action ability that can only be resolved once per game. See 7.2.4. for more on Epic Actions
An event is a type of card. When a player plays an event, they place the event in its owner's discard pile, then they resolve the event's ability. See 3.3. Event
An event ability is an ability found in the text box of an event card. See 7.4. Event Abilities
"Excess damage" refers to damage that would be dealt to a unit beyond the amount needed to defeat that unit. See 1.9.11. for more on excess damage
A card is exhausted when it is turned sideways (rotated 90 degrees). Some action abilities require a card to exhaust itself, and will indicate this with the ?
symbol. See 1.5.4. Ready and Exhausted
An Experience token is a type of token upgrade that gives a unit +1 power and +1 HP. See 3.7. Token
When playing a card that has Exploit, a player can defeat a number of units up to the number specified. For each unit defeated this way, the cost of the card
being played is reduced by 2. See 7.5.16. Exploit
Abilities that refer to the "first" occurrence in a phase refer to the very first occurrence that phase, regardless of whether the card with the ability was in play
when it occurred. See 8.9. First
Abilities that take the form "For each X, do Y" are resolved by determining how each instance of the ability will be resolved, then resolving all instances
simultaneously. See 8.35. "For Each"
If an ability instructs a player to play a card "for free," the player bypasses all modifiers to that card's cost, including the aspect penalty, and does not pay any
resources to play that card. The player must still pay any additional non-resource costs applied to the card. See 1.8.5. for more on "for free"
Abilities that specify a duration, like "for this attack" or "for this phase," are known as lasting effects. Lasting effects only affect the game for the specified
amount of time. See 7.7.3. Lasting Effects

A card that a player controls is considered a "friendly" card for that player. See 1.5.3. Friendly and Enemy

The "game area" refers to all zones in the game collectively. See 4. Zones

The "game state" refers to: each card's current zone, controller, attributes, and status; the initiative counter's controller and status; the status of open and hidden information for a player; and the status of all active lasting effects and delayed effects. An action, ability, or payment of a cost that changes any of these elements is considered to change the game state. A player must change the game state when taking any action other than passing. See 1.16. Game State

Abilities often tell a player to "give" a unit a token or a power/HP modifier or indicate that a unit "gets" that modifier. See 3.7. Token & 8.16. Modifiers

A unit with the Grit keyword gets +1 power and +0 HP for each damage on it. See 7.5.6. Grit

The ground arena is a zone shared by players. Ground units are played into the ground arena. See 4.3. Ground Arena

Each player's hand is its own zone. A player can have any number of cards in their hand. See 4.7. Hand

When an ability or effect heals a number of damage from a card, remove that many damage counters from that card. See 1.9. Damage

Hidden information refers to cards that have restrictions on when they can be viewed, and by whom. A card may be hidden information for one player but not another. See 1.17. Open and Hidden Information

HP, or Hit Points, is an attribute that indicates how much damage a card can have on it before it is defeated. Units and bases have HP values. See 1.11. HP

An HP modifier is an attribute that modifies the attached unit's HP value by the printed number. Only upgrades have an HP modifier. See 2.11. HP Modifier

If an ability uses the phrase "if you do," the text preceding "if you do" must be resolved in full in order to resolve the text following "if you do." See 8.10. "If You Do"

If a player is instructed to "ignore" a keyword ability, they treat that ability as inactive, as specified by the "ignore" effect. If a player is instructed to "ignore" the aspect penalty for a card, they pay the cost of the card without accounting for any aspect icons on the card that aren't provided by the player's leader and/or base. See 8.11. Ignore

Cards in the ground arena, space arena, base zones, and resources zones are considered "in-play." By default, cards that are in-play have the potential to
affect the game through use of their abilities, power, and HP. See 4.9. In-Play and Out-of-Play

The initiative is a game concept represented by the initiative counter. The player that controls the initiative counter is the first active player in a round and takes the first action. During a player's turn, they may use the Take the Initiative action, ensuring they will go first in the next round. See 1.15.5. Take the  Initiative

An ability that uses "instead" indicates a replacement effect in which the standard resolution of a triggering condition or ability is replaced with an alternate
resolution. See 7.7.5. Replacement Effects
A keyword or keyword ability is a card ability indicated with bold red text and that has specific associated rules. See 7.5. Keyword Abilities
Last known information is information about a card that's no longer in play, accounting for the controller of the card and modifiers applied to that card immediately before it left play. Last known information is used primarily when resolving a "When Defeated" ability on a card that left play. See 8.12. Last Known Information
A lasting effect is a part of an ability that affects the game for a specified duration of time. Most lasting effects include the phrase "for this phase" or "for this attack." See 7.7.3. Lasting Effect
A leader is a double-sided card that represents an iconic Star Wars character. Each deck has 1 leader. Each leader starts the game in its owner's base zone,
and most leaders can be deployed as units during the game. See 3.4. Leader
A card leaves play when it moves from an in-play zone to an out-of-play zone (for example, when a unit is defeated and moved to its owner's discard pile) or when it is turned facedown. See 8.13. Leaves Play
When a player is instructed to "look at" cards from a specific zone, the player picks up those cards and views them, keeping them secret from other players. The player cannot change the order of those cards. After viewing, the player returns the cards to the zone in the same order and orientation as they were previously. See 8.14. Look At
Abilities may cause a card to lose some or all of its abilities, including specific keywords. See 8.15. Lose, Loses
A modifier refers to a change of a printed value on a card through an ability applied to that card or an upgrade attached to that card. When a modifier is applied to a printed value, it creates a modified value, which in turn is used to resolve abilities or actions that depend on that value. See 8.16. Modifiers
During game setup, if a player is unsatisfied with their opening hand, they may take a mulligan by shuffling that hand back into their deck and drawing a new
opening hand. The player must keep this new hand. See 5.2. Starting the Game and Setup
If a card ability states that an effect "must" happen or a specific choice "must" be made, the player has to resolve the ability as specified, as much as they are
able. See 8.17. "Must"
A card's name is located at the top of the card. An ability may refer to a card's name or require a player to name a card. See 2.2. Name
If an ability instructs a player to "name a card," that player clearly indicates the name of any card in Star Wars: Unlimited (such as by saying its name out loud), and applies the rest of the ability to any cards with that name in the game. These abilities do not account for subtitles; the player does not need to specify a subtitle when naming a card. See 8.18. Name a Card
A nested ability occurs when resolving one triggered ability causes a second ability to trigger; the second ability is a nested ability. Any abilities triggered before a nested ability is triggered must be put on hold until the nested ability resolves. See 7.6. Triggered Abilities

13. INDEX/GLOSSARY

CONTENTS	GLOSSARY

Some triggered abilities are indicated with "On Attack" in bold, followed by a colon and an effect. On Attack abilities are resolved when the unit they're on attacks, after the defender is chosen but before units deal combat damage. See 7.6.15. On Attack

Open information refers to cards that can be viewed by any player at any time. See 1.17. Open and Hidden Information

A player's opponent is a person playing the game other than that player. See 1.4. Players, Active Player

A card with an ability that uses "other" or "another" cannot apply the effects of its ability to itself. Additionally, an event ability may use "other" or "another" to separate the first card it affects from a different card that it affects. See 8.19. Other, Another

Cards in decks, hands, and discard piles are "out-of-play." By default, cards that are out-of-play don't have the potential to affect the game through use of their
abilities, power, and HP; an ability must state that it affects the game while out-of-play, or be a type of ability that does. See 4.9. In-Play and Out-of-Play

When an attacker with the Overwhelm keyword deals combat damage to a defender, its controller deals any excess damage to the defending player's base.
See 7.5.7. Overwhelm

A player is the owner of any card that started the game in their deck. See 1.5.2. Ownership and Control

When a player passes, they are considered to have done nothing during their action. See 1.15.6. Pass

In case of a conflict between a restrictive ability and a permissive ability, the restriction takes precedence. See 1.3.3. for more on "Restrictions Override  Permissions"

A round is made up of two phases: an action phase and a regroup phase. See 5.4. Action Phase & 5.5. Regroup Phase

The plan counter is an additional counter added in the Twin Suns format used to end a player's participation in a round. When a player takes the plan counter, they immediately draw 1 card from their deck, then place 1 card from their hand on the bottom of their deck. See 12.5. Counters

To play a card, a player selects a card in their hand, pays resources equal to its cost, and either puts it into play if it is a unit or upgrade, or puts it in their discard pile and resolves its ability if it is an event. See 6.2. Play a Card

A player's play area consists of cards the player controls in in-play zones, with the exception of any upgrades the player controls attached to enemy units; this includes cards in their base zone, cards in their resource zone, units they control, and upgrades attached to units they control. See 4.10. Play Area

A play restriction is a condition that prevents a card from being played. Play restrictions are checked before paying the costs to play a card. See 8.20. Play  Restrictions

A player is a person participating in the game. See 1.4. Players, Active Player

Power is an attribute that indicates how much damage a unit deals in combat. See 1.10. Power
A power modifier is an attribute that modifies the attached unit's power value by the printed number. Only upgrades have a power modifier. See 2.9. Power 
Modifier
If an ability prevents damage from being dealt to a unit or base, do not place any damage counters on that unit or base. Damage is not considered dealt to that unit or base, and abilities that would trigger when damage is dealt don't trigger. See 8.21. Prevent (Damage)
Printed is a term used in rules text to refer to an attribute physically printed on a card to differentiate that attribute from modifiers, abilities, and effects applied to the card. This term is used for rules clarification purposes, such as when explaining the steps of modifying a card's cost. See 8.22. Printed
If an ability instructs a player to put a card into play as a resource, the card is placed facedown and exhausted in that player's resource zone unless otherwise
specified. The card is not considered "played" and no "When Played" abilities trigger. See 1.7. Resources
When a unit with the Raid keyword attacks, it gets extra power equal to the value following Raid. See 7.5.8. Raid
A card is ready when it is turned upright. See 1.5.4. Ready and Exhausted
Each game round is made up of two phases: an action phase and a regroup phase. During a regroup phase, players draw cards, choose whether to resource,
and ready exhausted cards. See 5.5. Regroup Phase
A unit's remaining HP is determined by subtracting the number of damage on it from its HP value. If a unit's remaining HP is zero or less, that unit is defeated.
See 1.11. HP
Reminder text is italicized text in parentheses following an ability that helps clarify rules for that ability. Reminder text has no inherent mechanical effect. See 
2.13.2. for more on reminder text
A replacement effect occurs when the standard resolution of a triggering condition or ability is replaced with an alternate resolution. This alternate resolution is the replacement effect. See 7.7.5. Replacement Effect
A resource is a type of game object a card becomes when put into a play in a resource zone. Players pay the cost of cards by exhausting resources they
control. A resourced card's printed attributes are inactive and do not affect the game unless otherwise specified. See 1.7. Resources
Each player has a resource zone which contains the resources that they control. See 4.5. Resource Zone
When a unit with the Restore keyword attacks, its controller heals damage from their base equal to the value following Restore. See 7.5.9. Restore

In case of a conflict between a restrictive ability and a permissive ability, the restriction takes precedence. See 1.3.3. for more on "Restrictions Override  Permissions"

Some card abilities will "return" a specific type of card to its owner's hand. By default, only cards that are in play can be returned this way; an ability must
specify that it is returning a card from an out-of-play zone in order to do so. See 8.25. Return

To reveal a card means to show the faceup side of the card to all players. Abilities can cause a player to reveal cards from their deck, hand, or resource zone.
See 8.26. Reveal

A game round consists of two phases: an action phase and a regroup phase. See 5.3. Round

When a unit with the Saboteur keyword attacks, it ignores enemy units with the Sentinel keyword in its arena, and it also defeats all Shield tokens on the defender. See 7.5.10. Saboteur
